# Hello World

**Live:** https://vibes.tlab.sh/hello-world/

A simple greeting vibe to test the vibes setup.

## Features

- **Real-time input** - Type your name and see a personalized greeting instantly
- **Copy to clipboard** - One-click copying of the greeting message
- **Shareable URLs** - The name is stored in the URL hash for easy sharing
- **Mobile-friendly** - Responsive design with touch-optimized inputs

## Usage

1. Enter your name in the text input
2. A greeting appears with a gradient background: "Hello, [name]!"
3. Click **Copy greeting** to copy the message to your clipboard
4. Share the URL with others - the name persists in the URL hash

The vibe automatically updates the URL as you type, so refreshing the page or sharing the link preserves the entered name.

## Initial prompt

The initial prompt for this vibe was not recorded. This README was reconstructed based on the implementation.
