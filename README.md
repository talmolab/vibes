## About

Each "vibe" is a self-contained HTML application with inline CSS and JavaScript. No build steps, no frameworks - just HTML that works.

Inspired by [simonw/tools](https://github.com/simonw/tools) and the [vibe coding](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/10/html-tools/) philosophy.

A [Talmo Lab](https://talmolab.org) project.
